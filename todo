watch redis tutorial again and write it down
do what u need to do to connect to project and use it

redis stores in ram and is just for cache and will be deleted. changed to mysql.


1- delete group
1- delete message

check if it can send message to a group where its not joined in, but id is still in db


messages should be saved in redis and sql like:
message_id,message_text etc
so that u can find them when edited and do ur changes...
